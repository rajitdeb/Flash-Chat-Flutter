# About - Flash Chat Flutter 🌟
A multi-user chat app built using Firebase and Flutter.

## Objective 🎯
The objective of this project is to learn how to incorporate Firebase into Flutter apps. We'll be using Firebase Cloud Firestore as well as the Firebase authentication package to equip our app with a cloud-based NoSQL database and secure authentication methods. And also understand the nity-gritty of firebase firestore and authentication.
